Then, it was 102.5 -- the highest I've ever had aside from the flu over a decade ago.  I slept ALL day that day -- the day after the vaccine, with my temperature gradually lowering to only 99 by the 3rd morning.  During that time, my left arm was extremely sore, and my whole body was weak and achy (just like the flu).  I did not, (thank you, Jesus) have an gastro-intestinal distress.  According to the internet, only 1 in 6 patients have this reaction.  This was my 2nd dose and I had no reaction to the 1st one, 12 months prior. A friend of mine who is a doctor said that 9 out of 10 of her patients taking this vaccine DO have this reaction.  I do believe that the public should be made aware so they can plan ahead for this debilitating shot.

The Project was a multi-site, prospective cohort study of pregnant women who were members of medical group during the 20102011 influenza season. Women and their newborns were followed until six months post-delivery. Potential participants were pregnant women identified through electronic health records (EHR) and were contacted for recruitment between Dec-2010 and May-2011.  The maternal demographics, behavioural characteristics and medical conditions included: maternal race/ethnicity, age (less than 30, 3034, more than 35 years), education (high school or less, some college/college graduate, Master's degree or higher), prenatal vitamin use (unspecified minerals and vitamins) (yes/no), alcohol use during pregnancy (yes/no), smoking during pregnancy (yes/no), parity (0, 1+), and month of conception during typical wintertime flu season (Nov-Mar) or not during flu season (Apr-Oct). Influenza vaccination status in the year prior to pregnancy was also ascertained from the EHR.  On an unspecified date, during 2010-2011 influenza season, the patient's mother was administered trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) [influenza virus vaccine polyvalent; dose, route od administration, anatomical location, batch number and expiry date: not reported] (explicitly coded as Foetal exposure during pregnancy') for influenza vaccination.

She also received intramuscular Engerix-B (non-company suspect) (lot number: 2KJ42) for an unknown indication.  Case report: The consumer took the first dose of Vivotif on 24-Jan-2019 and Engerix-B. After 1 hour, she had a headache and abdominal discomfort. She took Tylenol (paracetamol) for it but got no relief. Approximately three hours later, she had a massive headache and severe stomach pain. In the late morning, she had vomiting and loose stools, which persist for hours. Next morning, she felt fatigued but condition was improved.   The consumer's past medical history included stomach bug (December 2018). She had no allergy.   The consumer had no concomitant medication.  The consumer had no laboratory tests.  Action taken with Vivotif was unknown.  The consumer had recovered from the events of fatigue, headache, abdominal discomfort, stomach pain, vomiting, and loose stools on 25-Jan-2019.  Company's Comment: In this case, the consumer experienced ""sore throat"", ""headache"", ""influenza like symptoms"", ""high fever"" and ""body pain"" following administration of Vivotif and intramuscular Engerix-B. There seems to be a temporal association between the intake of Vivotif and the events. Hence, the causality of the events with Vivotif was assessed as possible. Additionally, co-administration of multiple vaccines also provides a plausible explanation for the reported events.; Sender's Comments: Company's Comment: In this case, the consumer experienced ""sore throat"", ""headache"", ""influenza like symptoms"", ""high fever"" and ""body pain"" following administration of Vivotif and intramuscular Engerix-B.

915259,"""About an hour after receiving the Pfizer covid vaccine, I developed a red itchy area on my opposite scapula/back. It went away after roughly 30min and then reappeared on a small part of my neck. I went to employee health, notified them, and was given a Claritin. While waiting for it to work, the top of my head and bottom of my feet itches for just a minute. The employee health nurse thought my reaction could have been from the latex on the top of the vial. In the past I've gotten mild localized rashes from latex bandaids. Perhaps if the vial was made of something other than latex that may have prevented or minimized my reaction. Or reaction could be from something else, as I've never gotten this reaction from other vaccines before.

Initial thought was a paralytic ileum which was subsequently discounted. Discharged on 11/26 and directed to get a colonoscopy.  December 2019. Colonoscopy on 12/5  uneventful, no ileus. Walking/balance/gait continued to deteriorate. Unable to get a neurologist appointment.  January 2020. Saw neurologist on 1/3. He prescribed a brain MRI which demonstrated no signs of MS. He wasn't available to see me again until March 23, 2020. Went to Urgent care clinic on 1/13 and given a prescription for doxycycline to rule out possible Lyme disease as a cause. No positive effect. Saw an osteopath for an EMG test on 1/22 and he indicated the need for neurology treatment and also prescribed a lumbar MRI, which demonstrated no inflammation, just stenosis. Saw a peripheral nerve disease doctor on 1/28 who upon receipt of MRI's of my thoracic region of the spine, referred me to colleague who specialized in spinal disorders.  February 2020. On Feb 5th, after being diagnosed with transverse myelitis, commenced a 5 day steroid infusion.

Doctor consulted with an infectious disease doctor and together they decided to put me on a 3 week infusion of ceftriaxone to take Lyme disease off the table  that started about 2/20.

Xrays established nothing more than normal deterioration. Had another thoracic spine MRI on 6/26 which demonstrated that inflammation had abated. Bowel issues continue.  July/August 2020. Continued PT. Slow but steady walking improvement. Balance better but still not stable. Gait, awkward. Using predominantly cane, exclusively in August. Bowel issues continue.  September 2020.

Chronology is compatible. The subject's mother history of polycystic ovarian syndrome, gestational diabetes mellitus and obesity (body mass index 41.8) may provide alternative aetiology for the event.

This case is linked to cases 2020SA001262, 2020SA001225, 2020SA001235 and 2020SA001250 (Same reporter).  The following is verbatim from the article:  Background: Since the last review of vaccine safety surveillance data for erythema multiforme (EM), Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS), SJS/TEN, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (EM/SJS/TEN), over 37 new vaccines have been introduced. We sought to describe reported EM/SJS/TEN after vaccines during 1999-2017.  Methods: We identified reports of EM/SJS/TEN received by the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) during 1999-2017. We stratified analysis by condition (EM, SJS, or TEN), and analyzed reports by serious or non-serious status, sex, age group, time from vaccination to symptom onset, exposure to known causes of EM/SJS/TEN, and vaccines administered. We used Empirical Bayesian data mining to detect vaccine-AE pairs reported more frequently than expected. Results: Of 466,027 reports to VAERS during 1999-017, we identified 984 reports of EM, 89 reports of SJS, 6 reports of SJS/TEN, and 7 reports of TEN. Few reports of EM (9%), and most reports of SJS (52%), SJS/TEN (100%), and TEN (100%) were serious. Overall, 55% of reports described males, 48% described children aged 4 years; 58% of EM/SJS/TEN occurred 7 days after vaccination. Few reports (5%) described exposure to known causes of EM/SJS/TEN. Overall, childhood vaccines (e.g., combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine) were most commonly reported. We identified 6 deaths; 4 were exposed to medications associated with EM/SJS/TEN. EM after smallpox vaccine was reported disproportionately among people aged 19 - 49 years.  Conclusions: EM/SJS/TEN were rarely reported after vaccination; data mining identified a known association between EM and smallpox vaccine.  This case involves a 43 years old female patient who experienced Stevens-Johnson syndrome (Stevens-Johnson syndrome), respiratory failure (respiratory failure) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (toxic epidermal necrolysis) while she received vaccine INFLUENZA VACCINE.

The subject's current conditions included obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and anxiety. It was noted that the subject had a pregnancy in advanced age.  The subject's concomitant medications included Prenatal vitamins (unspecified vitamins and minerals) for pregnancy.  The subject's obstetrical history noted that the subject had two previous full-term, live birth pregnancies with no birth defects. The subject had no history of offspring with major congenital malformation (MCM). Also, the subject had no maternal or paternal history with MCM. The subject did not use tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs during pregnancy.   The subject's last menstrual period (LMP) date was on 07-Feb-2019, the estimated delivery date (EDD) and corrected estimated date of delivery (CEDD) were both reported as 02-Dec-2019. The type of pregnancy was singleton.   On 01-Apr-2019, the subject underwent haemoglobin electrophoresis and no MCMs were noted.  On 16-Apr-2019, the subject underwent ultrasound and no MCMs were noted.  On 20-Jun-2019, the subject underwent ultrasound and no MCMs were noted.  On 03-Oct-2019, the subject underwent ultrasound and no MCMs were noted.  On 17-Oct-2019, at approximately 33 weeks of gestation, the subject was administered Flucelvax QIVc (Flu Vaccine Cell Subunit QIV NVD) [influenza vaccine, subunit influenza virus vaccine polyvalent, batch number: 261218, dose: 0.5 mL, route of administration, anatomical location and expiration date: not reported] (explicitly coded as 'Vaccine exposure during pregnancy') for influenza immunisation.

The neonate's birth weight was 2750 grams, length was 50.2 cm and head circumference was 33 cm. The appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, and respiration (APGAR) scores were 8 (one minute) and 9 (five minutes). The APGAR score for ten minutes was not reported. No MCMs were identified at the time of birth.   At the time of this report, the outcome for the event of 'premature delivery' was not reported.  The event of premature delivery' was considered as serious due to criterion of medical significance, per company.  The reporter did not provide causality assessment.  This case is linked to case number 202001701 (the corresponding baby case).  Company comment: It was reported that the male neonate was delivered via Caesarean section several weeks after vaccination. A Caesarean section in general, and in particular if conducted prior to the term, would suggest an underlying cause prompting this method over vaginal delivery. No other pregnancy complications were reported which precludes thorough assessment of causality. Based on the available information, causality for the event of premature delivery was considered unassessable. Vaccine exposure during pregnancy was assessed as unrelated to the vaccine in line with internal conventions.; Sender's Comments: It was reported that the male neonate was delivered via Caesarean section several weeks after vaccination.

Within hours after my vaccination I began feeling slightly detached from what was going on around me, more like I was observing life rather than participating- - although I was active. This feeling continued and was more noticeable the second day before starting to recede. Right after that I began to discover that I had developed both a lack of recall (names, words) and lack of concentration. I would walk across the kitchen, reach a cupboard and could not remember what I went there to get. Or I would unthinkingly open the wrong cupboard or drawer. Also, I would walk off in the middle of doing something and forget about it until I passed by again and saw my unfinished project.  I began making an effort to remind myself of the names of flowers, trees, etc. in our yard. I looked up names of relatives in our family tree (my husband is the youngest of 11 children). Most of that re-learning has stuck with me, but sometimes not until after repeated times of reminding myself. Some problems have toned down but are still with me. Others still happen repeatedly such as misplacing my cell phone. Occasionally I forget to feed our feral outdoors cat until reminded, or I forget a load of dry clothes in the dryer for a day or two.
